## Overview

KubeVirt Redfish is a Redfish-compatible API server for KubeVirt/OpenShift Virtualization that enables management of virtual machines through standard Redfish protocols. This can be extremely useful for advanced Redfish automation within a virtualized environment. For example, when using OpenShift's Advanced Cluster Manager, you can create simulated Redfish endpoints for end-to-end [Zero Touch Provisioning](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18/html/edge_computing/ztp-deploying-far-edge-sites) (ZTP) workflows. We welcome contributions from the community and are actively seeking additional maintainers to help grow the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Go 1.21+** - [Download from golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/)
- **Git** - [Download from git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
- **Make** - Usually pre-installed on Unix-like systems
- **Container Runtime** - Docker or Podman
- **Kubernetes Cluster** - For integration testing (minikube, kind, or OpenShift)
- **Helm 3.12+** - [Download from helm.sh](https://helm.sh/)

### Setup

1. **Fork and Clone:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kubevirt-redfish.git
   cd kubevirt-redfish
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/kubevirt/redfish-controller.git
   ```

2. **Quick Setup (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   make dev-setup          # Install dependencies and tools
   make create-config      # Create default configuration
   make build-local        # Build for local development
   ```

3. **Environment Variables (Optional):**
   ```bash
   # Container registry settings
   export REGISTRY="quay.io"
   export NAMESPACE="your-namespace"
   export IMAGE_NAME="kubevirt-redfish"
   
   # Registry authentication (for pushing images)
   export QUAY_USERNAME="your-username"
   export QUAY_PASSWORD="your-password"
   
   # Test configuration
   export TEST_HOST="localhost"
   export TEST_PORT="8443"
   export TEST_USER="testuser"
   export TEST_PASS="testpass"
   ```

```

### Configuration

Create a custom configuration for your development:

```bash
make create-config    # Create default configuration
vim config.yaml       # Edit configuration
```

Example configuration:
```yaml
server:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8443
  tls:
    enabled: false

chassis:
  - name: "chassis-0"
    namespace: "namespace-0"
    service_account: "redfish-sa"
    description: "Test chassis"

authentication:
  users:
    - username: "admin"
      password: "admin123"
      chassis: ["chassis-0"]
```

### Development Process

1. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make changes and validate:**
   ```bash
   make fmt lint validate    # Format, lint, and validate code
   make test                 # Run tests
   ```

3. **Test locally:**
   ```bash
   make build-local          # Build for local development
   make test-local           # Test locally
   ```

## Testing & Quality

### Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
make test                 # Run all unit tests
make test-coverage        # Run tests with coverage report
make test-race           # Run tests with race detection
make test-short          # Run short tests only

# Integration tests (requires K8s cluster with KubeVirt)
make test-integration    # Run integration tests

# Local testing
make test-local          # Build and test locally
make test-api            # Test HTTP API endpoint
make test-api-https      # Test HTTPS API endpoint
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Code formatting and validation
make fmt                 # Format code
make lint                # Run golangci-lint
make validate            # Run all validation checks

# Coverage
make test-coverage       # Generate coverage report
open coverage.html       # View coverage in browser
```

### API Testing Examples

```bash
# Test Redfish API endpoints
curl -s -u admin:admin123 http://localhost:8443/redfish/v1/ | jq .
curl -s -k -u admin:admin123 https://localhost:8443/redfish/v1/ | jq .
```
